Hello, my name is <b>Gabriel Chaves</b>. <br >
I study Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas at IFSP at Cubatão campus, where i'm currently at the second semester. <br >
Also, i work at Trular, a promising company that works with real state data, where i'm currently a Junior Developer, working on many different
projects, that list is currently:
<ul>
  <li>The main website, wich is <a href="https://trular.com.br/" target="_blank">Trular</a>, wich uses the Nextjs framework and storybook, where we try to
  mantain a clean and simple codebase, using the market best practices</li>
  <li>Internal projects, such as the "admin" webpage and an phone app, using React Native with Expo</li>
  <li>Web Scraping with python scrapy library</li>
</ul>
<br/>
I'm really interested into learning new things, from physical activities like skating, to learning a new development framework, i believe that constant
progress is the key to having a promissing future, no matter in what this progress is about.

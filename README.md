Hello, my name is <b>Gabriel Chaves</b>. <br >
I study Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas at IFSP at Cubatão campus, where i'm currently at the second semester. <br >
Also, i work at Trular, a promising company that works with real state data, where i'm currently a Junior Developer. <br >
I'm really interested into learning new things, from physical activities like skating, to learning a new development framework, i believe that constant
progress is the key to having a promissing future, no matter in what this progress is about.
